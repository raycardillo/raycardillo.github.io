# Ray Cardillo's Publications

Links (or archived documents) for some of the more formal publications I've done... when I was doing that kinda thing.

#### [The Commercialization of SOA](./2008_06_01_ServiceOrientedArchitecture.pdf)

_Raymond A. Cardillo_

_Journal of Software Technology (Jun 1, 2008)_

The publication this article appeared in targets information technology and software engineering issues for the Department of Defense community. The article itself discusses why it's so difficult to define SOA in any certain terms in a market full of vendors seeking to capitalize on the SOA trend as a marketing driven effort (and not a technology driven effort).


#### [Detecting people of interest from internet data sourcesDetecting people of interest from internet data sources](http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.665718)

_Raymond A. Cardillo, John J. Salerno_

_SPIE: Data Mining, Intrusion Detection, Information Assurance, and Data Networks Security 2006 (Apr 18, 2006)_

Building from previous success, we used similar techniques against a new source of data (the public ENRON email dump). We simply added an email extraction module and replaced the visualization code with a better library. This rather simple strategy once again demonstrated that the "people of interest" could be easily determined merely by visualizing the information in a novel way.


#### [Knowledge representation requirements for situation awarenessKnowledge representation requirements for situation awareness](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1591822)

_J. Salerno, D. Boulware, R. Cardillo_

_8th International Conference on Information Fusion (Jul 25, 2005)_

A discussion about our attempts to create a framework by which knowledge can be inferred from both top-down and bottom-up approaches in attempt to uncover facts from data systematically in the hopes of increasing Situational Awareness.


#### [Comparing various algorithms for discovering social groups with uni-party dataComparing various algorithms for discovering social groups with uni-party data](http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.603680)

_John J. Salerno, Raymond A. Cardillo, Zhongfei Mark Zhang_

_SPIE: Data Mining, Intrusion Detection, Information Assurance, and Data Networks Security 2005 (Mar 28, 2005)_

Introduces a framework for systematically identifying "people of interest" in a large corpus of data, and provides a statistical analysis of the efficacy of an algorithm (CORAL) that attempts to do so with a high degree of accuracy as compare to other techniques.


#### [The pearls of using real-world evidence to discover social groupsThe pearls of using real-world evidence to discover social groups](http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.603763)

_Raymond A. Cardillo, John J. Salerno_

_SPIE: Data Mining, Intrusion Detection, Information Assurance, and Data Networks Security 2005 (Mar 28, 2005)_

Describes our first attempts to detect "people of interest" in a large corpus of data using novel extraction method (name disambiguation tools), a simple weighting algorithm, and a novel visualization technique (a physics force based layout).
